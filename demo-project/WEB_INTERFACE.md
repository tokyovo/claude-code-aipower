## üîß Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture

**State Management:**
- Client-side state stored in `tasks` array
- Filters stored in `currentFilters` object
- Re-renders on state changes

**API Communication:**
- Centralized `apiCall()` function
- Handles errors and displays toast notifications
- Async/await for clean asynchronous code

**UI Patterns:**
- Event delegation for dynamic elements
- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Modal dialogs for editing
- Toast notifications for feedback

### Backend Architecture

**Express Server:**
- Serves static files from `/web` directory
- REST API at `/api/*` endpoints
- CORS enabled for development
- Error handling middleware

**API Layer:**
- `setupAPI()` function creates all routes
- Wraps TaskManager instance
- Validates inputs
- Returns consistent JSON responses

### REST API

All API endpoints return JSON in this format:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

- `sortBy` - Sort field (createdAt/priority/title)
- `order` - Sort order (asc/desc)

## üé≠ Testing with Playwright MCP

### What is Playwright MCP?

Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Claude Code to control a web browser for automated testing and interaction. It's configured in the project's `.mcp.json` file and provides tools for:
- Browser navigation and interaction
- Taking screenshots for debugging
- Reading page content
- Clicking, filling forms, and more
- Generating test code from manual actions

### Prerequisites

1. **MCP Configuration**: Ensure `.mcp.json` exists in project root with Playwright MCP configured
2. **Web Server Running**: Start the server with `npm start`
3. **Claude Code Restarted**: Restart Claude Code after adding/changing MCP configuration

### Basic Playwright Commands

#### Navigate and Screenshot
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and take a screenshot
```

Claude will open the web app in a browser and capture the current state.

#### Create a Task
```
Use Playwright to create a task "Buy milk" with high priority
```

Claude will:
- Fill the title input field
- Select priority from dropdown
- Click the "Add Task" button
- Take a screenshot to verify

#### Test Filtering
```
Create 3 tasks with different priorities, then test that the High priority filter works correctly
```

Claude will create test data and verify the filter behavior.

### Common Test Scenarios

#### 1. Task Creation Workflow
```
Test the complete task creation workflow:
1. Fill in task details
2. Add tags
3. Verify task appears in list
4. Check statistics update
```

#### 2. Task Completion
```
Create a task, mark it complete, and verify:
- Checkbox is checked
- Task has strikethrough style
- Statistics show 1 completed task
```

#### 3. Filter Testing
```
Test all filter combinations:
- Status filters (All/Active/Completed)
- Priority filters (All/High/Medium/Low)
- Verify correct tasks are displayed
```

#### 4. Search Functionality
```
Create tasks with different titles, then test search:
- Search for specific keywords
- Verify only matching tasks shown
- Test case-insensitive search
```

#### 5. Export Features
```
Create sample tasks and test export:
- Click "Export JSON" button
- Verify download is triggered
- Check file contains correct data
```

### Screenshot Debugging

Use screenshots to debug UI issues:

```
Take screenshots at each step:
1. Before creating task
2. After filling form
3. After clicking submit
4. After task appears
```

Compare screenshots to identify where issues occur.

### Generating Test Code

Playwright MCP can generate reusable test code:

```
Start a Playwright codegen session to record:
1. Creating a new task
2. Editing the task
3. Marking it complete
4. Deleting the task

Then end the session and save the generated test file
```

The generated code will be in standard Playwright format and can be run with `npx playwright test`.

### Example Test Files

Check the [`playwright-tests/`](playwright-tests/) folder for example tests:
- **example-task-creation.spec.js**: Task CRUD operations
- **example-filtering.spec.js**: Filter and search testing
- **example-export.spec.js**: Export functionality testing

### Tips for Effective Testing

1. **Start with clean state**: Refresh page between tests
2. **Use descriptive names**: Name screenshots clearly
3. **Verify state changes**: Check before and after actions
4. **Test edge cases**: Empty forms, invalid input, etc.
5. **Check statistics**: Verify counts update correctly

### Troubleshooting Playwright

#### Browser doesn't open
- Verify `.mcp.json` is configured correctly
- Restart Claude Code after configuration changes
- Check that Playwright MCP server is running

#### Elements not found
- Inspect element in DevTools to get correct selectors
- Use more specific CSS selectors if needed
- Wait for page to load before interacting

#### Screenshots are blank
- Ensure page has finished loading
- Try taking full-page screenshots
- Check browser viewport dimensions

#### Tests fail intermittently
- Add wait times for async operations
- Use `waitForSelector` before interactions
- Check for network delays or slow responses

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

**Problem:** Port 3000 is already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### API returns 404

**Problem:** Endpoint not found

**Solution:**
- Check the URL spelling
- Ensure server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoint exists in [server.js](web/server.js)

### Tasks not displaying

**Problem:** Empty screen or errors in console

**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify server is running
5. Try refreshing the page

### CORS errors

**Problem:** Browser blocks API calls

**Solution:**
- The server already has CORS enabled
- Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost:3000`
- Check that origin matches server URL

### Changes not reflecting

**Problem:** Code changes don't appear

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart the server
4. Check for JavaScript errors in console

---

## üé® Customization

### Change Port

Edit [web/server.js](web/server.js):
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

### Modify Styling

Edit [web/styles.css](web/styles.css):
- Change colors in `:root` variables
- Modify component styles
- Adjust responsive breakpoints

### Add Features

**Example: Add a "Clear All" button**

1. **Add HTML button** in [index.html](web/index.html):
```html
<button id="clear-all-btn" class="btn btn-danger">Clear All</button>
```

2. **Add event listener** in [app.js](web/app.js):
```javascript
document.getElementById('clear-all-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  if (confirm('Delete all tasks?')) {
    await apiCall('/tasks', { method: 'DELETE' });
    await loadTasks();
  }
});
```

3. **API already supports it** - `DELETE /api/tasks`

1. Start with [index.html](web/index.html) - See the UI structure
2. Look at [styles.css](web/styles.css) - Understand the styling
3. Read [app.js](web/app.js) - Follow the JavaScript logic
4. Check [server.js](web/server.js) - Learn about the backend

**For intermediate developers:**
- Study the state management pattern
- Analyze the API communication flow
- Review error handling strategies
- Examine the responsive design approach

**For advanced developers:**
- Consider adding authentication
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
- Add data persistence (database)
- Create automated tests

### Next Steps

1. **Extend the API** - Add new endpoints
2. **Enhance the UI** - Add animations, themes
3. **Add Features** - Due dates, reminders, attachments
