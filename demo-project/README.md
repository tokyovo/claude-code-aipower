## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the Project with Claude

Open Claude Code in this directory and run:

```
/init
```

This will help Claude understand your project structure and context.

### 2. Review Project Context

Check out [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) to see how project context is defined. This file tells Claude:
- What this project is about
- Code style preferences
- Architecture decisions
- Common patterns to follow

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## üìñ Step-by-Step Demo Guide

### Session 1: Adding Context to Claude

#### Exercise 1A: Using /init Command
1. Open a new Claude Code conversation
2. Run `/init` and observe how Claude reads your project
3. Ask Claude: "What is this project about?"
4. Notice how Claude references the CLAUDE.md file

#### Exercise 1B: Using @ File Mentions
1. Ask Claude: "Can you explain @src/task.js?"
2. Try: "Review @src/taskManager.js and suggest improvements"
3. Practice mentioning multiple files: "@src/task.js and @src/utils.js"

#### Exercise 1C: Adding Custom Instructions with #
1. Type `#` to add a memory/instruction
2. Example: "Always use JSDoc comments for functions"
3. Ask Claude to add a new function and see if it follows your instruction

#### Exercise 1D: Understanding CLAUDE.md Hierarchy
- **Project-level**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (this project)
- **Personal**: `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` (your preferences, not in git)
- **Global**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (all your projects)

Try creating a `CLAUDE.local.md` with your personal coding preferences.

---

### Session 2: Making Changes with Claude

#### Exercise 2A: Using Screenshots (Ctrl+V)
1. Create a simple UI mockup or diagram
2. Take a screenshot
3. In Claude Code, paste with Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac)
4. Ask: "Implement this UI design as a CLI interface"

**Try this scenario:**
- Draw a simple flowchart showing task creation workflow
- Paste it and ask Claude to implement the logic

#### Exercise 2B: Planning Mode (Shift + Tab)
1. Press **Shift + Tab** to enter Planning Mode
2. Ask: "Add a feature to export tasks to JSON and CSV formats"
3. Claude will create a plan without making changes
4. Review the plan, then approve or modify it

**Why use Planning Mode?**
- Complex features with multiple files
- You want to review before execution
- Experimental or risky changes

#### Exercise 2C: Thinking Modes
Try different thinking modes for various tasks:

1. **Think** (default): "Add input validation to task creation"
2. **Think more**: "Refactor the task manager to use async/await"
3. **Think a lot**: "Design a plugin system for custom task types"
4. **Think longer**: "Optimize the search algorithm for large task lists"
5. **Ultrathink**: "Architect a scalable task management system with plugins"

**Guideline:**
- Simple changes ‚Üí No special thinking
- Moderate complexity ‚Üí Think more
- High complexity/architecture ‚Üí Think a lot or longer
- Novel solutions needed ‚Üí Ultrathink

#### Exercise 2D: Planning vs Thinking - When to Use What?

**Use Planning Mode when:**
- You need to review changes before they happen
- Multiple files will be affected
- You're unsure about the approach
- You want to discuss the implementation strategy

**Use Thinking Modes when:**
- The task requires complex reasoning
- You need creative problem-solving
- Architecture decisions are needed
- Optimizing algorithms or patterns

**Pro tip:** You can combine them! Use Planning Mode with a thinking mode.

### Session 3: Controlling Conversation

#### Exercise 3A: Interrupting with Escape
1. Ask Claude to make a large change
2. Press **Escape** while Claude is working
3. Redirect: "Actually, let's do this differently..."

**Practice scenario:**
- "Refactor all files to use classes"
- (Press Escape mid-execution)
- "Stop - let's just refactor task.js first"

#### Exercise 3B: Combining Escape with Memories
1. Interrupt Claude with Escape
2. Type `#` to add an instruction
3. Example: "Always ask before refactoring existing code"
4. Continue the conversation with this new rule

#### Exercise 3C: Rewinding Conversations (Escape √ó 2)
1. Make several changes with Claude
2. Press **Escape twice** to see conversation history
3. Select an earlier point to rewind to
4. Continue from that point with a different approach

**Try this workflow:**
- Add a feature (approach A)
- Realize you want a different approach
- Rewind to before the feature
- Implement approach B instead

#### Exercise 3D: Context Management Commands

**Using /compact:**
```
/compact
```
- Summarizes the conversation so far
- Keeps important context, reduces tokens
- Use when: Long conversation, approaching context limits

**Using /clear:**
```
/clear
```
- Completely fresh start
- Clears all conversation history
- Use when: Starting a completely new task

**Best Practice:**
- Long debugging session ‚Üí `/compact` to summarize findings
- Switching to unrelated task ‚Üí `/clear` for fresh start
- Need to preserve some context ‚Üí Rewind instead of `/clear`

---

### Session 4: Custom Commands

#### Exercise 4A: Understanding Custom Commands

Custom commands are stored in `.claude/commands/` as markdown files.

**File structure:**
```
.claude/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.md          # Simple command, no arguments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ write_tests.md    # Command with $ARGUMENTS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ review.md         # Another custom command
```

#### Exercise 4B: Using the /audit Command

Run the audit command:
```
/audit
```

This command checks your code for:
- Missing error handling
- Undocumented functions
- Code quality issues
- Security concerns

**Check the implementation:** [.claude/commands/audit.md](.claude/commands/audit.md)

#### Exercise 4C: Using /write_tests with Arguments

Write tests for a specific file:
```
/write_tests src/task.js
```

Or for multiple files:
```
/write_tests src/task.js src/utils.js
```

**Key concept:** `$ARGUMENTS` in the command file gets replaced with what you type.

**Check the implementation:** [.claude/commands/write_tests.md](.claude/commands/write_tests.md)

#### Exercise 4D: Using the /review Command

Get a code review:
```
/review src/taskManager.js
```

This provides:
- Code quality assessment
- Best practice suggestions
- Potential bug identification
- Refactoring opportunities

#### Exercise 4E: Creating Your Own Command

Create a new command: `.claude/commands/document.md`

```markdown
Analyze $ARGUMENTS and generate comprehensive documentation including:
- Function descriptions
- Parameter details
- Return value documentation
- Usage examples
- Edge cases

Use JSDoc format for JavaScript files.
```

**To activate:**
1. Save the file
2. Restart Claude Code (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Reload Window")
3. Run: `/document src/task.js`
