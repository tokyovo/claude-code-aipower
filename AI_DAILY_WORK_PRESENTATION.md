# Using AI in Daily Life and Work

## Presentation Outline

### 1. Setting the Right Mindset for AI Adoption
**Why This Matters**: In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI literacy is becoming as essential as digital literacy. Those who embrace AI tools now will have a significant advantage in productivity and problem-solving capabilities.

**Key Points**:
- AI is a tool to augment human capabilities, not replace them
- Early adopters gain competitive advantages in both personal and professional contexts
- The learning curve is smaller than you think - start small, build gradually
- Resistance to AI adoption may lead to being left behind in efficiency and innovation

### 2. Demo: AI Agent Mode (Running in Background)
**What We'll Do**: Start an AI agent task that runs autonomously while we explore other features.

**Why Start Here**: Agent mode can take time to complete complex tasks, so we'll let it work in the background while covering other topics.

**Example Tasks**:
- Research and summarize a complex topic
- Analyze and organize large datasets
- Generate comprehensive reports or documentation
- Multi-step problem-solving that requires sustained reasoning
